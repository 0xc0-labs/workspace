# Closed design — 0xc0-labs

Status: **closed**. Not reopened without an explicit decision from the operator.

This file records the decisions. How the pieces fit together, with diagrams,
is in [`infrastructure/docs/architecture.md`](https://github.com/0xc0-labs/infrastructure/blob/main/docs/architecture.md).

## Addressing

| Group    | Supernet     | Zones          |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| control  | 10.10.0.0/22 | mgmt .0, ci .1 |
| platform | 10.10.4.0/24 | platform       |

Three zones (operator decision, 2026-09-24): `mgmt` and `ci`, which build and
reach everything else and never depend on it, and `platform`, which holds the
Kubernetes cluster and its load balancer. Separation inside the cluster is by
namespace and NetworkPolicy, not by zone.

Reserved so they never overlap:
`10.11.0.0/16` node 2 · `10.20.0.0/16` Hetzner Cloud and vSwitch ·
`10.42.0.0/16` RKE2 pods · `10.43.0.0/16` RKE2 services ·
`10.66.66.0/24` future lab.

| platform | vm-rke2-04   | Rocky  | RKE2 agent                                        |

Sizes and addresses are in `infrastructure/docs/zones.md`.

**The three RKE2 nodes are identical, and all three are servers** (operator
decision, 2026-09-27): each runs the control plane and etcd, and takes
workloads. In Kubernetes the role is configuration, not a different machine;
three servers keep etcd's quorum through the loss of one VM.

**Capacity grows with agents; etcd stays at three servers** (operator
decision, 2026-09-30). An agent runs workloads only, with no control plane or
etcd: a fourth server would tolerate no more failures than three, and two
would tolerate none. `vm-rke2-04` is the first, sized and disked like the
servers, Longhorn included. On one host it adds capacity, not availability.

**Outside the cluster, deliberately:** the vm-access pair is the admin way in,
and the vm-ci pair builds and changes the infrastructure, the cluster included.
Neither may depend on what it has to fix.

**Two CI VMs, identical** (operator decision, 2026-09-29): CI keeps running
while one is down, and a job on one can rebuild the other, so no rebuild of a
CI VM has to run from the laptop.

**The RKE2 nodes run Rocky Linux 10**, the latest release RKE2 supports
(RHEL 10 and its derivatives, with the package that allows `nf_conntrack`;
operator decision, 2026-09-24). They clone their own template chain, from the official
Rocky cloud image, as the Debian VMs do from theirs.

**The load balancer is deployed with the cluster**: the same OpenTofu module
creates the nodes and the two LB VMs, and Ansible writes HAProxy's backends from
the node list. HAProxy fronts the Kubernetes API (6443, 9345) and the ingress
NodePorts; keepalived moves its VIP between the two VMs.

The host (`pve-1`, `pve.0xc0.cc`) holds `.1` in every zone and is the router
and the firewall. `eno1` keeps the public IP. Each zone is an SDN VNet with no
physical port, and egress is SNAT through `eno1` — Hetzner drops unknown MACs
on the public interface, so guests never bridge onto it.

Besides Proxmox, the host runs the base services, **outside IaC**:

- **Traefik** — reverse proxy for the Proxmox UI, PBS and RustFS.
- **RustFS** — S3-compatible store holding the OpenTofu state (`s3.0xc0.cc`).
- **PBS** — backups, with the datastore on a Hetzner Storage Box.

## Transit

The matrix that decides is the `transit` variable in
`infrastructure/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars`: the `zone-firewall` module
computes every rule from it. `infrastructure/docs/zones.md` explains it. In
short:

| From     | To       | Ports                                                   |
|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| mgmt     | ci       | 22                                                      |
| mgmt     | platform | 22, 443 (portals), 6443 (Kubernetes API), 8200 (Vault)  |
| mgmt     | node     | 22, 443, 8006                                           |
| mgmt     | mgmt     | 22, between the vm-access connectors                    |
| ci       | platform | 22, 6443                                                |
| ci       | mgmt     | 22, from the CI VMs only: Ansible on the vm-access pair |
| ci       | node     | 443, 8006 (API, not SSH)                                |
| internet | node     | 22, break-glass; closed at the Hetzner firewall         |
| platform | platform | the cluster's own traffic, and VRRP between the LBs     |
| platform | node     | 9100 (node metrics)                                     |

Inside `platform`, the cluster needs more than TCP (VXLAN for the pod network,
VRRP for keepalived), so each entry in the matrix can name its protocol.

The node is on a DROP policy: 22, 443 and 8006 from the admin zones, 22 never
from ci, the metrics port from platform, and from the internet only SSH, as
break-glass (operator decision, 2026-09-26): the Hetzner firewall keeps it
closed until the operator opens it, and sshd is key-only. Traefik (Proxmox UI,
PBS, RustFS) is reached over WARP, where Gateway resolves its hostnames to the
node's address in mgmt. If WARP breaks, the way back is that SSH, then the
Hetzner Rescue system.

No other zone initiates towards mgmt, with one exception: SSH from the CI VMs'
addresses, not the whole `ci` zone, so the pipeline can run the vm-access
playbook (operator decision, 2026-09-29).

## Flows

- **Web**: Cloudflare → public tunnel → cloudflared on the LB VMs → HAProxy
  (layer 4) on 443 → NodePort → Traefik, with CrowdSec's bouncer → service.
  cloudflared talks HTTPS to Traefik and checks its certificate, with the
  request's host as SNI. The client's address reaches Traefik as
  `CF-Connecting-IP`, trusted only from `platform`.
- **TLS** (operator decision, 2026-09-29): it ends at Traefik, on both paths,
  with a Let's Encrypt wildcard per domain (`*.d` and `d`) from cert-manager,
  through DNS-01 challenges in Cloudflare. Port 80 only redirects to HTTPS.
  Domains: `0xc0.cc` and `offby1.cc`; `sergioaten.cloud` once the Cloudflare
  token reaches its zone.
- **Public names**: the tunnel serves every name of the domains in
  `public_domains`, but a name is public only once external-dns gives it a
  record (a proxied CNAME to the tunnel), which it does only for an HTTPRoute
  annotated `gateway.0xc0.cc/public: "true"`. Only zones in the tunnel's own
  Cloudflare account can be public: a CNAME to it from another account's zone
  (`offby1.cc`) fails at the edge (1014). external-dns is part of the platform
  on purpose (operator decision, 2026-09-29).
- **Portals** (OpenObserve, ArgoCD, Headlamp): internal, reached only over WARP.
  None has a public record, and none is published behind Cloudflare Access
  (operator decision, 2026-09-29).
- **Internal services** (operator decision, 2026-09-30): a path of their own,
  separated by network. A second VIP on the LBs, `10.10.4.9`, sends its 443
  to Traefik's `internal` entrypoint; Cloudflare Gateway resolves every
  `*.int.0xc0.cc` name to it for WARP devices, and those names have no public
  record. The public tunnel only ever targets the public VIP, so nothing from
  the internet reaches the internal path. Headlamp, the Kubernetes UI, is
  one, at `headlamp.int.0xc0.cc`, logged into with a short-lived token. The
  internal path has no WAF: CrowdSec's bouncer is on the public entrypoint
  only.
- **Admin**: WARP → admin tunnel → either vm-access connector → any zone. The
  Kubernetes API, SSH, Vault, Proxmox, PBS and RustFS are reached **only** this
  way, never through the public tunnel.
- **Deploy**: infrastructure through the runners on the CI VMs (Proxmox API,
  SSH), OpenTofu, Packer and every Ansible playbook alike (operator decision,
  2026-09-29): `--check`/plan on the PR, the real run on merge behind manual
  approval. Nothing is applied from the laptop. What runs in the cluster goes
  through ArgoCD, from the `gitops` repo.
- **Egress**: VM → `.1` of its zone → NAT behind the public IP.

**ArgoCD is installed with the cluster, and everything else in the cluster by
ArgoCD** (operator decision, 2026-09-29, replacing the OpenTofu root of
2026-09-27). The Ansible playbook that brings RKE2 up also writes ArgoCD's
`HelmChart` and its root `Application` into RKE2's manifests directory, and
RKE2's own helm-controller installs it. An OpenTofu root would have needed
Ansible to have run first, and the admin kubeconfig outside the servers;
this needs neither. RKE2's helm-controller keeps managing ArgoCD itself, so
two controllers never fight over it. From there ArgoCD deploys every other
component (Longhorn, Traefik, CrowdSec, Vault, monitoring, applications) from
the `gitops` repo, which is public: no repo credentials. A private repo would
get a read-only GitHub App, its key from Vault through Ansible the same way.

**Vault runs in the cluster** (operator decision, 2026-09-24). A running
cluster never needs Vault to start: the RKE2 token and ArgoCD's admin password
are already in files only root reads on the servers, written there by Ansible,
which reads them from Vault (`ci/infrastructure/*`). ArgoCD deploys Vault, and
the components take their secrets from it through Vault Secrets Operator. No
secret lives in `gitops`, not even encrypted. Vault is unsealed by hand after a
restart. A cluster built from nothing needs Vault restored first, from PBS:
the accepted risk below.

**Vault's shape** (at the operator's request, 2026-09-30; gitops#33): three
servers in HA over integrated storage (Raft), one per RKE2 node, each on a
Longhorn volume. Shamir seal: the keys
live in the operator's password manager and offline, never in the cluster or
any repo. It is on the WARP-only path, `https://vault.int.0xc0.cc`; Traefik ends
TLS, and inside the cluster the API is plain HTTP behind NetworkPolicies
(Raft's port is TLS with Vault's own certificates; there is no TLS between
pods on the API). No agent injector: Vault Secrets Operator reads it. The
init and unseal runbook is `gitops/platform/vault/README.md`.

**OpenObserve for metrics, logs and traces** (operator decision, 2026-10-01;
gitops#44), the lightest way to have all three: one backend, single node, on
a Longhorn volume, with its own dashboards and alerts, and PromQL for the
metrics. It replaces Prometheus + Grafana, and lifts the discard of logs and
traces. The OpenTelemetry Operator runs the collectors: one agent per node
for every container's logs and the nodes' and pods' metrics, and one gateway
for traces over OTLP, Kubernetes events, and every Prometheus target, which
each component declares with a ServiceMonitor and its target allocator finds.
The control plane's metrics (etcd, scheduler, controller manager) are exposed
on the RKE2 servers for it. Retention is 30 days. The open-source edition
has no SSO: its own users, on the WARP-only path, `https://o2.int.0xc0.cc`.

**Every application is observable from the day it is deployed** (operator
decision, 2026-10-03; workspace#52). The change that deploys it ships all of
this, never a follow-up:
- **logs:** to stdout or stderr, with a level the collector can parse. A log
  the application writes to a file is followed onto stdout by a sidecar
  (Mautic's).
- **metrics:** at least Traefik's per-route traffic and the kubelet's per-pod
  resources, on the "Apps" dashboard; its own endpoint, with a ServiceMonitor,
  when it has one.
- **traces:** OTLP to the collector's gateway, joined to Traefik's trace
  through `traceparent`. That means egress to the gateway, and the namespace
  admitted in the collector's `otlp-from-senders`.
- **RUM, when it has a frontend:** OpenObserve's browser SDK, sending through
  the application's own name (`/rum/v1/default/rum`, POST only, rate limited,
  with a ReferenceGrant to OpenObserve). It stores nothing on the visitor's
  browser and records no session replay, so it needs no consent banner. The
  client token is public by design, and lives in Vault like any credential.

**Vault Secrets Operator, not External Secrets Operator** (operator decision,
2026-09-30). Vault is the only backend, so ESO's reach across backends buys
nothing, while VSO renews dynamic secrets' leases (the data services'
short-lived credentials) and restarts what uses a secret when it changes,
with no Reloader beside it. No global access: each namespace brings its own
`VaultAuth`, bound to a Kubernetes auth role named after it, which reads only
its own paths.

**Secrets are laid out by trust boundary** (operator decision, 2026-09-30):
one KV v2 engine each, `platform/` (the shared services), `apps/` (the
applications) and `ci/` (the pipelines), with paths `<engine>/<owner>/<name>`,
the owner being the namespace or the repo. A fourth, `ops/`, holds what only
people use, UI logins and passwords in clear, and no machine has a policy on
it (operator decision, 2026-10-02). A credential both need gets a form for
each: the machine the bcrypt or the htpasswd line, the person the password. A
secret belongs to the service it is for, not to its reader: ArgoCD's is
`platform/argocd/admin`, granted by name to infrastructure's CI, which writes
it into the cluster. Keys inside are `snake_case`, and
every secret carries `owner` and `rotated_at` metadata. A policy scopes to one
owner; the `vault` repo defines engines, roles and policies, never values. A
secret more than one consumer uses is not copied: it lives once, at
`<engine>/shared/<name>`, and each consumer's policy grants it by name
(operator decision, 2026-09-30).
There are no dynamic engines (`pki/`, `database/`); one is added when
something needs it. `apps/` has one Kubernetes auth role, `apps`, for every
namespace labelled `vault.0xc0.cc/apps`, and one templated policy, which
reads the path of the namespace the login comes from instead of one policy
each (noted 2026-10-01), plus `apps/shared/openobserve-rum` by name. The
full standard is in the `vault` repo's README.

**Vault is configured with OpenTofu from its own repo, `vault`** (operator
decision, 2026-09-30; .github#6): auth methods and roles, policies, secret
engines. It is downstream of `gitops`, which deploys Vault, so the order stays
linear: `.github → infrastructure → gitops → vault → offby1.cc and app-*`.
Its CI logs in with the job's GitHub OIDC token (JWT auth,
`hashicorp/vault-action`): no Vault credential is stored. A PR plans
read-only from any ref (role `terraform-plan`); only `main`, inside the
`production` environment that waits for the operator, writes (role
`terraform`). Neither policy touches a stored secret. The CI VMs
reach Vault on the internal VIP (`ci → platform: 443`).
The CI can only log in once its auth method and roles exist, so **the first
apply of `vault` is local**: the operator runs it once, over WARP, with the
root token (operator decision, 2026-09-30). It is the one exception to nothing
being applied from the laptop; every change after it goes through the
pipeline. The root token is kept, outside Vault, with the unseal keys
(operator decision, 2026-10-04).

**The ingress is Traefik, with the Gateway API, and the WAF is CrowdSec**
(operator decision, 2026-09-29). open-appsec was the plan, and it was set aside:
every Kubernetes integration it has runs on something retired or unmaintained
(ingress-nginx, retired in March 2026; Kong, with no free images since 3.10;
Istio 1.23-1.26 and Envoy 1.32-1.34, all end of life; APISIX on unmaintained
etcd images). Cloudflare Free covers DDoS and the most exploited CVEs; what it
leaves, application attacks on public apps without Access, is CrowdSec's:
Traefik's bouncer checks every request against CrowdSec's AppSec component
(virtual-patching rules, no CRS to tune) and its community blocklist, shared in
return for the attacking IPs, never request contents. The load balancers stay
layer 4, with no WAF of their own. open-appsec can be reconsidered for the
public applications.

**Longhorn is the cluster's storage** (operator decision, 2026-09-29): the
default `StorageClass`, three replicas on different nodes, on each RKE2 node's
two data disks, the agents' included. It has no backup target of its own: **PBS backs the VMs up whole**,
data disks included, and that is what the timed restore tests.

**Non-negotiable: a tested restore.** If the RTO is not measured in writing,
it is not tested.

**One shared MariaDB for the applications that need MySQL** (operator
decision, 2026-10-02; gitops#71): one server in `platform/mariadb`, one
database and one user per application, never a server per application.
MariaDB over MySQL: fully GPL, lighter at rest, and both Mautic and WordPress
support it. A plain StatefulSet from the official image, **no operator**: it
costs memory the cluster does not have to spare. PBS's backup restores the
server whole, every database at once, so a nightly logical dump per database
lets one application be restored alone. An application that needs another
engine version gets its own server, as the exception.

**Mautic runs as one instance, no tenants** (operator decision, 2026-10-02;
gitops#73).
The official image's three roles (web, cron, worker) run as containers of one
pod, sharing one Longhorn RWO volume, so there is no RWX volume and no NFS
share-manager. Its database is in the shared MariaDB. It is public at
`mautic.0xc0.cc` for what contacts reach. Every admin path (`/s`, the
installer, the API) answers 403 there, with no hint of the internal name
(operator decision, 2026-10-02; gitops#78), and is reached only at
`mautic.int.0xc0.cc`, WARP only, so its login is never on the internet. It runs from `apps/`, under its own narrower
`AppProject`.

**Payload CMS runs as one multi-tenant instance** (operator decision,
2026-10-09; workspace#64), the backend of several frontends: one tenant
per frontend, through Payload's multi-tenant plugin. Its code is the
`payload` repo, private like `artistlabco.com`. It is public at `payload.0xc0.cc` for the API and media
the frontends read; `/admin` answers 403 there and is reached only at
`payload.int.0xc0.cc`, WARP only, as Mautic's admin is. Its media sits on
a Longhorn RWO volume, so it runs one replica.

**One shared PostgreSQL for the applications that need it** (operator
decision, 2026-10-09; workspace#64): Payload does not support MySQL or
MariaDB. One server in `platform/postgres`, with the same rules as the
shared MariaDB: one database and one role per application, a plain
StatefulSet from the official image with no operator, and a nightly
logical dump per database.

**Application repos carry the `app` topic** (operator decision,
2026-10-09), set in `.github`'s `terraform.tfvars` with the others.

Zones are Proxmox SDN: one Simple zone, a VNet and a subnet per zone, the host
as `.1` and SNAT for egress, all in OpenTofu through `bpg/proxmox`. Zones
spanning nodes do not exist: there is one node. Native Proxmox firewall through the same
provider.

## Templates

Every VM clones a template baked by Packer (operator decision, 2026-09-24).
Each chain starts from an official cloud image, which OpenTofu imports through
the Proxmox API as a raw template that no VM clones:

- **Debian**: `debian-13-cloud` → `debian-13-base` (the `base` role: guest
  agent, SSH hardening) → `debian-13-runner`.
- **Rocky**, for the RKE2 nodes: the Rocky cloud image → its base template,
  with the same `base` role, which then supports both families.

What is per VM or secret, the VM's role included, stays with cloud-init and
Ansible.

Templates carry no version. Each takes a fixed VMID from its range (operator
decision, 2026-09-29): 9000-9099 for the raw images, 9100-9199 for Packer's.
VMs keep the VMIDs Proxmox assigns. Everything still finds a template by name.
A rebuild deletes it and builds it again under the same VMID;
VMs are full clones and ignore later changes to their template, so moving one
onto a rebuilt template is a deliberate `rebuild`.

## Secrets

**Every secret lives in Vault, and none in a repo** (operator decision,
2026-10-01, .github#6), not even encrypted. SOPS, which held them until then,
is gone.

- **Layout:** the engines by trust boundary (`ci/`, `platform/`, `apps/`) and
  `ops/` for people; the paths, the shared rule and one service per path are
  above, under the stack's Vault.
- **CI:** each job logs in with GitHub's OIDC token. There is one JWT role per
  repo, bound to its repository and to `.github`'s reusable workflows on
  `main`, and a policy that names what it reads. No Vault credential and no
  Actions secret is stored anywhere.
- **The cluster:** each component reads through Vault Secrets Operator, with a
  Kubernetes auth role per namespace. What RKE2 and ArgoCD boot with, Ansible
  reads from Vault in CI.
- **Locally:** the scripts read Vault with the operator's token (`vault login
  -no-print`, over WARP), into the environment only.
- **Writing and rotating:** the operator does it by hand, in Vault (`vault`
  repo, README). The Cloudflare token is the one credential that crosses
  engines: one copy in `ci/shared/cloudflare` and one in
  `platform/shared/cloudflare`, rotated together.
- **Outside Vault:** what restoring Vault takes cannot live in it. The unseal
  keys and root token, PBS and its Storage Box, Hetzner Robot and Rescue,
  Proxmox `root@pam`, RustFS admin, and the Cloudflare and GitHub accounts
  with their 2FA are kept in the operator's password manager and an offline
  copy (`vault` README, "Recovery credentials: outside Vault").

## Accepted risks

- Single piece of hardware, with no second node: a hardware failure is an RTO
  of hours.
- Disks in RAID 0 (operator decision, 2026-09-23): one NVMe failure loses the
  whole node. Recovery is a reinstall plus a restore from PBS on the Storage
  Box, which is why that restore has to be tested and timed.
- Dependency on Cloudflare to get in, with Hetzner Rescue as the way out.
- One cluster holds shared services and applications, Vault included: they are
  separated by namespace and NetworkPolicy, not by zone.
- Vault is sealed after every restart until it is unsealed by hand; meanwhile
  applications get no new secrets.
- Inside the cluster Vault's API is plain HTTP, held in by NetworkPolicies,
  until pod-to-pod TLS: tokens and secrets cross from Traefik to the pod
  unencrypted.
- The public tunnel's connectors run on the LB VMs: public traffic enters
  `platform`, never `mgmt`.
- The CI VMs reach the vm-access connectors over SSH, so a compromised CI VM
  reaches the admin way in. It already holds the keys that change the whole
  infrastructure.
- The WAF (CrowdSec) learns nothing and protects only what its rules know:
  virtual patching for known CVEs and IP reputation, not a model of each
  application's normal traffic.
- Longhorn's pods may egress anywhere: restricting it risks breaking storage
  silently, for little gain (operator decision, 2026-09-29, gitops#10).
- cert-manager and external-dns use OpenTofu's Cloudflare token, which can
  also change the tunnels, Zero Trust and Access: whoever reads its Secret in
  the cluster gets all of that (operator decision, 2026-09-29). One token
  serves both, in Vault (`platform/shared/cloudflare`); a DNS-only one was
  turned down (operator decision, 2026-09-30).
- Every secret lives in Vault and nowhere else (operator decision,
  2026-10-01). With the cluster or Vault down, no pipeline runs and no local
  script gets credentials until Vault is restored from PBS and unsealed (the
  runbook is in the `vault` repo's README). PBS's backup of the RKE2 servers is
  the only other copy.
- The control plane's metrics are reachable from the whole `platform` zone
  (operator decision, 2026-10-02; infrastructure#158): etcd's on 2381, plain
  HTTP and unauthenticated, and the scheduler's and controller manager's on
  10259 and 10257, behind the API's authorization. That includes the load
  balancers, whose cloudflared connectors face the internet. They expose
  telemetry, not data or control; narrowing them to the RKE2 VMs needs the
  transit matrix to name cluster VMs as sources.
- A portal on the public path (`websecure`) stays internal only by having no
  public record. Every internal service goes on the internal path instead,
  which the public tunnel cannot reach.

## Repos and policies

`infrastructure` and `.github`: `main` only, PR required, apply behind manual
approval. Applications: each decides whether it has a test environment; one
that does promotes test→prod with the same digest, never a rebuild.
ArgoCD points at `gitops/bootstrap/prod/`, which deploys `platform/` and
`apps/`.

## How we work

One orchestrator session in the workspace and one session per repo, instead
of one session in the workspace editing every repo (operator decision,
2026-10-10; workspace#74).

**Two roles.**

- **The orchestrator**: `claude -n orchestrator`, in the workspace. It plans,
  opens the issues, hands each repo its part, and checks what crosses repos.
  It edits the workspace repo (the design, the rules) and the board, and no
  other repo's files.
- **A repo session**: `claude -n <repo>`, in that repo, opened by the operator
  in a named tab when the repo is in play. It loads that repo's `CLAUDE.md`,
  plugins and permissions, works only there, and goes up to a draft PR.

They talk through Claude Code's messages between local sessions. When a
repo's session is not open, the orchestrator asks the operator to open it;
it does not start one on its own.

**Repo sessions take their own work from the board.** One board for every
repo, `artistlabco.com` included (`CLAUDE.md`, Tracking, has how an issue is
filed). An issue turns **Ready** only with a complete contract and with what
it depends on applied: GitHub's "blocked by" orders the sub-issues of a change
across repos, and the orchestrator, or the operator, moves an issue to Ready
once its blockers are closed. Todo holds the rest. A repo session opened as
`claude -n <repo> "/work-issue"` takes its repo's Ready issue of highest
priority and moves it to In Progress, which is the claim; when it finishes
one, it looks for the next before it stops. A session acts only on a turn, so
one with nothing Ready waits, and the orchestrator, when it moves an issue to
Ready, messages that repo's session to look again. No session polls the board
on a timer: every look is a turn of the model, paid whether or not anything
is there. An issue set Ready by hand, past the orchestrator, is seen at the
session's next look.

**The issue is the contract.** A repo session starts with no memory of the
conversation behind its task, so everything it needs is in its issue: the
outcome, the acceptance criteria, the branch name, the sibling issues and the
merge order. The orchestrator's message points at the issue and adds nothing
the issue lacks. The repo session answers with a short report: the PR, its
checks, what it could not do, and any question for the operator.

**The orchestrator owns integration.** A green PR in every repo is not a
working change. Before a set of PRs is called done, the orchestrator checks
all of them, their merge order, and what one repo does to another: a policy
another repo's plan needs, a setting a repo inherits from the workspace, a
hook a session lacks. Each of those slipped through on 2026-10-10 while every
PR on its own was green.

**Plugins and permissions by kind of repo.** Every repo enables `0xc0` in its
own `.claude/settings.json`. The infrastructure repos (`.github`,
`infrastructure`, `gitops`, `vault`, `claude-config`) work with `0xc0`'s
agents and skills, with strict permissions. The application repos add
gentle-ai at workspace scope and the official plugins they need, and an
unattended session there may work up to a draft PR (operator decision,
2026-10-10).

**What stays the operator's**: marking a PR ready, merging, every apply,
writing and rotating secrets, and which repos' sessions are open.

**Cost.** Every session draws on the operator's Claude subscription, and
several at work spend it faster than one. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the
environment and no `--bare`, either of which bills the API instead.

Before anything depends on it, it runs as a pilot on one real change that
crosses repos.
